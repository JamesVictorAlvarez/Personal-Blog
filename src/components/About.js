                            I'm a Computer Science student at Vanier College, fueled by a passion for coding and game development. 
                            My hands-on experience includes building websites and creating games within the Unity engine.  
                            I find the limitless potential of technology incredibly exciting, and I'm eager to explore 
                            how I can use my skills to design innovative solutions and immersive gaming experiences.
